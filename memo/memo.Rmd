This document should contain a detailed account of the data clean up for your data and the design choices you are making for your plots. For instance you will want to document choices you've made that were intentional for your graphic, e.g. color you've chosen for the plot. Think of this document as a code script someone can follow to reproduce the data cleaning steps and graphics in your handout.

## Data Clean Up Steps for Overall Data

The original data for this project came from a Google Sheet that was exported to Excel. It was extremely difficult to work with in R due to its inconsistent formatting. Each age group (3–4 and 4–5 year olds) had its own sheet, and within those sheets, data for Fall, Winter, and Spring was spread across different sections horizontally. The formatting included missing category labels, merged cells, and non-data rows like headers and expectation labels, all of which made direct analysis impossible without extensive cleaning.

To prepare the data for analysis, we followed a multi-step cleaning process for each age group and each season. First, we read in the data using precise Excel cell ranges to isolate each seasonal block. We used the janitor::clean_names() function to standardize column names and made manual corrections to ensure all rows had appropriate category labels. We removed rows that contained labels rather than actual data, such as "Threes", "Bottom", or "Widely Held Expectations". The missing values in the "category" column were filled downward to maintain consistency. We added new columns to tag each observation by season, academic year, and age group. We then converted key fields to numeric values and replaced any remaining missing entries with zeros to ensure all values could be used in calculations. These steps were applied separately to each seasonal data block, and the cleaned datasets were combined into two master datasets—one for each age group—and finally merged into a single dataset called HS_2018_19_data.

## Plots

For our visualizations, we made several intentional design choices to make the plots both clear and accessible. We used the viridis color palette in all figures to ensure that the visuals are colorblind-friendly and have consistent, readable contrast. The seasons were manually re-leveled to appear in the correct chronological order—Fall, Winter, and Spring—on the x-axis. To show how scores changed over time, we used line plots where each line represented the mean percentage of students meeting or exceeding expectations for a given category or age group. To explore variation within each group, we used lineplots and faceted boxplots, which helped us visualize the distribution of scores and easily see overall trends. It was difficult to find ways to visualize individual group observations in an effective way, which is why we chose to use the visualizations we did.

### Plot 1:

```{r means-by-season, fig.alt="Line plot showing the mean percent of 3–5 year olds meeting or exceeding expectations across Fall, Winter, and Spring 2018–19, broken down by developmental categories. Each category (such as Cognitive, Language, and Social-Emotional) is represented by a separate colored line using a colorblind-friendly viridis palette. Points mark the seasonal means for each category, showing overall upward trends across the year in most categories."}

Two colored lines represent each age group using viridis colorblind-safe hues. Both groups show a general increase in scores across the year.
