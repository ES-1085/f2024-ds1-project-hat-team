## Summary

# Promise Early Education: Social-Emotional Development Trends in 2018–19

Background
Promise Early Education is a Head Start/Early Head Start program serving children ages 0–5 across Maine. Using the GOLD® Assessment System, Promise tracks children’s developmental outcomes in six domains—social-emotional, language, literacy, cognitive, physical, and mathematics—capturing progress across fall, winter, and spring checkpoints. For this project, we focused on social-emotional development from 2018-2019, a core pillar of school readiness, and visualized changes across time, age groups 3 to 5, and broader learning domains.

The first line graph displays the percent of children meeting or exceeding expectations in six developmental categories (Cognitive, Language, Literacy, Mathematics, Physical, and Social-Emotional) across the fall, winter, and spring seasons of 2018–19. All domains show a marked upward trend, illustrating a strong year-over-year impact of Promise Early Education’s programming. Notably, Physical and Language skills start relatively high in fall (~80%) and continue to rise steadily, while categories like Literacy and Cognitive, which begin lower (~40–50%), show steeper gains. By spring, most domains cluster above 85%, with Social-Emotional scores nearing 91%, underscoring the holistic nature of the intervention. This graph provides a big-picture view of success across developmental areas while highlighting where the most significant growth occurs.

The second line graph zooms in on social-emotional development by age groups (3–4 and 4–5 years). While both groups demonstrate growth over time, 3–4-year-olds consistently outperform the 4-5 age group, beginning near 52% and rising to approximately 94% by spring. In contrast, the 4–5 group starts lower (about 33%) and finishes at around 60%. This difference may reflect the challenge of meeting more rigorous expectations applied to older children, rather than a shortcoming in performance. It could also be caused by the speed at which children at different ages are able to retain new information, further proving the necessity of an Early Head Start program. These results suggest that Promise’s programming successfully scaffolds emotional development across age levels, but also raises questions about whether older children are receiving enough targeted support as benchmarks increase.

The third graph is a set of box plots showing the distribution of social-emotional scores by age group and season. In fall, both age groups show wide variance, especially the 4–5-year-olds, whose scores range from 0 to about 70%, with a lower median. As the year progresses, the distributions tighten: the spread narrows, and the medians increase—most notably for the 3–4 group, which reaches near-uniform high performance by spring. This pattern suggests not just overall improvement but a reduction in disparities, with more students achieving at or above standard levels. The narrowing range indicates Promise may be effectively closing early developmental gaps, an important equity-focused outcome.

All three graphs collectively support the idea that Promise’s programming effectively fosters growth across developmental domains, particularly in social-emotional learning.

Age-based trends reveal not just outcomes but structural expectations: younger children may appear to do better because they are assessed on more age-appropriate WHE (Widely Held Expectations).

The convergence in later seasons suggests intervention is effective regardless of starting point.

#### What We Missed 
These graphs do not differentiate between dual-language learners, special education status, or duration of enrollment—factors central to Promise’s core evaluation goals.
They don’t consider COVID-19’s impact longitudinally (this data is pre-2020).
Disaggregating outcomes by these dimensions in future work could offer more actionable insights.
